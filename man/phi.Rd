\usage{
phi(sets, p, na_value = NaN, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{sets}{(\code{list()})\cr
List of character or integer vectors.
\code{sets} must have at least 2 elements.}

\item{p}{(\code{integer(1)})\cr
Total number of possible elements.}

\item{na_value}{(\code{numeric(1)})\cr
Value that should be returned if the measure is not defined for the input
(as described in the note). Default is \code{NaN}.}

\item{...}{(\code{any})\cr
Additional arguments. Currently ignored.}
}
\value{
Performance value as \code{numeric(1)}.
}
\description{
Measure to compare two or more sets w.r.t. their similarity.
It is defined as the Pearson correlation between the binary
representation of two sets \eqn{A} and \eqn{B}.
The binary representation for \eqn{A} is a logical vector of
length \eqn{p} with the i-th element being 1 if the corresponding
element is in \eqn{A}, and 0 otherwise.

If more than two sets are provided, the mean of all pairwise scores
is calculated.
}
\details{
This measure is undefined if one set contains none or all possible elements.
