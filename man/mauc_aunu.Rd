\usage{
mauc_aunu(truth, prob, na_value = NaN, ...)

mauc_aunp(truth, prob, na_value = NaN, ...)

mauc_au1u(truth, prob, na_value = NaN, ...)

mauc_au1p(truth, prob, na_value = NaN, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{truth}{:: \code{factor()}\cr
True (observed) labels.
Must have the same levels and length as \code{response}.}

\item{prob}{:: \code{matrix()}\cr
Matrix of predicted probabilities, each column is a vector of probabilities for a
specific class label.
Columns must be named with levels of \code{truth}.}

\item{na_value}{:: \code{numeric(1)}\cr
Value that should be returned if the measure is not defined for the input
(as described in the note). Default is \code{NaN}.}

\item{...}{:: \code{any}\cr
Additional arguments. Currently ignored.}
}
\value{
Performance value as \code{numeric(1)}.
}
\description{
Multiclass AUC measures.
\itemize{
\item \strong{AUNU: AUC of each class against the rest, using the uniform class
distribution.} Computes the AUC treating a \code{c}-dimensional classifier
as \code{c} two-dimensional 1-vs-rest classifiers, where classes are assumed to have
uniform distribution, in order to have a measure which is independent
of class distribution change. (Fawcett 2001)
\item \strong{AUNP: AUC of each class against the rest, using the a priori class
distribution.} Computes the AUC treating a \code{c}-dimensional classifier as \code{c}
two-dimensional 1-vs-rest classifiers, taking into account the prior probability of
each class. (Fawcett 2001)
\item \strong{AU1U: AUC of each class against each other, using the uniform class
distribution.} Computes something like (see Hand (2001) for details)
the AUC of \code{c(c - 1)} binary classifiers (all possible pairwise
combinations).
\item \strong{AU1P: AUC of each class against each other, using the a priori class
distribution.} Computes something like AUC of \code{c(c - 1)} binary classifiers
while considering the a priori distribution of the classes as suggested
in Ferri (2009). Note we deviate from the the definition in
Ferri (2009) by a factor of \code{c}
The person implementing this function and writing this very
documentation right now cautions against using this measure because it is
an imperfect generalization of AU1U.
