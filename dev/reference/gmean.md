# Geometric Mean of Recall and Specificity

Measure to compare true observed labels with predicted labels in binary
classification tasks.

## Usage

``` r
gmean(truth, response, positive, na_value = NaN, ...)
```

## Arguments

- truth:

  ([`factor()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/factor.html))  
  True (observed) labels. Must have the exactly same two levels and the
  same length as `response`.

- response:

  ([`factor()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/factor.html))  
  Predicted response labels. Must have the exactly same two levels and
  the same length as `truth`.

- positive:

  (`character(1))`  
  Name of the positive class.

- na_value:

  (`numeric(1)`)  
  Value that should be returned if the measure is not defined for the
  input (as described in the note). Default is `NaN`.

- ...:

  (`any`)  
  Additional arguments. Currently ignored.

## Value

Performance value as `numeric(1)`.

## Details

Calculates the geometric mean of
[`recall()`](https://mlr3measures.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/tpr.md) R
and
[`specificity()`](https://mlr3measures.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/tnr.md)
S as \$\$ \sqrt{\mathrm{R} \cdot \mathrm{S}}. \$\$

This measure is undefined if recall or specificity is undefined, i.e. if
TP + FN = 0 or if FP + TN = 0.

## Meta Information

- Type: `"binary"`

- Range: \\\[0, 1\]\\

- Minimize: `FALSE`

- Required prediction: `response`

## Examples

``` r
set.seed(1)
lvls = c("a", "b")
truth = factor(sample(lvls, 10, replace = TRUE), levels = lvls)
response = factor(sample(lvls, 10, replace = TRUE), levels = lvls)
gmean(truth, response, positive = "a")
