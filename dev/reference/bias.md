# Bias

Measure to compare true observed response with predicted response in
regression tasks.

## Usage

``` r
bias(truth, response, sample_weights = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- truth:

  ([`numeric()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html))  
  True (observed) values. Must have the same length as `response`.

- response:

  ([`numeric()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html))  
  Predicted response values. Must have the same length as `truth`.

- sample_weights:

  ([`numeric()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html))  
  Vector of non-negative and finite sample weights. Must have the same
  length as `truth`. The vector gets automatically normalized to sum to
  one. Defaults to equal sample weights.

- ...:

  (`any`)  
  Additional arguments. Currently ignored.

## Value

Performance value as `numeric(1)`.

## Details

The Bias is defined as \$\$ \frac{1}{n} \sum\_{i=1}^n w_i \left( r_i -
t_i \right), \$\$ where \\w_i\\ are normalized sample weights. Good
predictions score close to 0.

## Meta Information

- Type: `"regr"`

- Range: \\(-\infty, \infty)\\

- Minimize: `NA`

- Required prediction: `response`
