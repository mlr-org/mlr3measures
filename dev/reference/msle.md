# Mean Squared Log Error

Measure to compare true observed response with predicted response in
regression tasks.

## Usage

``` r
msle(truth, response, sample_weights = NULL, na_value = NaN, ...)
```

## Arguments

- truth:

  ([`numeric()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html))  
  True (observed) values. Must have the same length as `response`.

- response:

  ([`numeric()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html))  
  Predicted response values. Must have the same length as `truth`.

- sample_weights:

  ([`numeric()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html))  
  Vector of non-negative and finite sample weights. Must have the same
  length as `truth`. The vector gets automatically normalized to sum to
  one. Defaults to equal sample weights.

- na_value:

  (`numeric(1)`)  
  Value that should be returned if the measure is not defined for the
  input (as described in the note). Default is `NaN`.

- ...:

  (`any`)  
  Additional arguments. Currently ignored.

## Value

Performance value as `numeric(1)`.

## Details

The Mean Squared Log Error is defined as \$\$ \frac{1}{n} \sum\_{i=1}^n
w_i \left( \ln (1 + t_i) - \ln (1 + r_i) \right)^2, \$\$ where \\w_i\\
are normalized sample weights. This measure is undefined if any element
of \\t\\ or \\r\\ is less than or equal to \\-1\\.

## Meta Information

- Type: `"regr"`

- Range: \\\[0, \infty)\\

- Minimize: `TRUE`

- Required prediction: `response`
