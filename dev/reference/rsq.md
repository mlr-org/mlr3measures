# R Squared

Measure to compare true observed response with predicted response in
regression tasks.

## Usage

``` r
rsq(truth, response, na_value = NaN, ...)
```

## Arguments

- truth:

  ([`numeric()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html))  
  True (observed) values. Must have the same length as `response`.

- response:

  ([`numeric()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html))  
  Predicted response values. Must have the same length as `truth`.

- na_value:

  (`numeric(1)`)  
  Value that should be returned if the measure is not defined for the
  input (as described in the note). Default is `NaN`.

- ...:

  (`any`)  
  Additional arguments. Currently ignored.

## Value

Performance value as `numeric(1)`.

## Details

R Squared is defined as \$\$ 1 - \frac{\sum\_{i=1}^n \left( t_i - r_i
\right)^2}{\sum\_{i=1}^n \left( t_i - \bar{t} \right)^2}, \$\$ where
\\\bar{t} = \sum\_{i=1}^n t_i\\.

Also known as coefficient of determination or explained variation.
Subtracts the
[`rse()`](https://mlr3measures.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/rse.md) from 1,
hence it compares the squared error of the predictions relative to a
naive model predicting the mean.

This measure is undefined for constant \\t\\.

## Meta Information

- Type: `"regr"`

- Range: \\(-\infty, 1\]\\

- Minimize: `FALSE`

- Required prediction: `response`
