#' @title Measure Registry
#'
#' @description
#' The [environment()] `measures` keeps track of all measures in this package.
#' It stores meta information such as minimum, maximum or if the
#' measure must be minimized or maximized.
#' The following information is available for each measure:
#' * `id`: Name of the measure.
#' * `title`: Short descriptive title.
#' * `type`: `"binary"` for binary classification, `"classif"` for binary or multi-class classification,
#'   `"regr"` for regression and `"similarity"` for similarity measures.
#' * `lower`: lower bound.
#' * `upper`: upper bound.
#' * `predict_type`: prediction type the measure operates on.
#'   `"response"` corresponds to class labels for classification and the numeric response for regression.
#'   `"prob"` corresponds to class probabilities, provided as a matrix with class labels as column names.
#'   `"se"` corresponds to to the vector of predicted standard errors for regression.
#' * `minimize`: If `TRUE` or `FALSE`, the objective is to minimize or maximize the measure, respectively.
#'   Can also be `NA`.
#' * `obs_loss`: Name of the function which is called to calculate the (unaggregated) loss per observation.
#' * `aggregated`: If `TRUE`, this function aggregates the losses to a single numeric value.
#'   Otherwise, a vector of losses is returned.
#' * `sample_weights`: If `TRUE`, it is possible calculate a weighted measure.
